## The Story
---

Garden Your Own Growth is a program organized by Earth Rebirth, a non-profit born in Norman, OK. The program worked to bring gardens to schools both as an education opportunity and as a way to bring fresh produce to school cafeterias. It has been overall successful but the biggest and most consistent struggle is managing the gardens without putting all the workload on just a handful of people. Our Garden Network application would help to solve that problem.

Rather than putting pressure on teachers or garden leaders to find the help needed to maintain gardens throughout the year, they would be able to schedule tasks and send push notifications to a pool of volunteers who would be incentivized to do said tasks by earning points that can be redeemed at local businesses.
